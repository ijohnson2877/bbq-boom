 			<h1> OUR STORY</h1>
 				<p>Have you ever seen a real life explosion, especially with animals involved? We sure have, and it inspired us to create the BBQ Boom, where "Our BBQ is the Bomb." It started as we were walking down the city streetys, when a man walks up and hands us an energy drink. "Runf aster, jump higher." he said, but we didn't want to be poisoned. We threw it on the ground! Just then, a nearby farm exploded and a crisp pig landed right in front of us, giving the inspiration for our restaurant.</p>
